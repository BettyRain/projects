Project 4 - Ticket Purchase Application
=======================================

You have two options for Project 4. 

### [Option 1](project4option1.md) - A two-tier ticket purchase web *site* with a SQL backend.

### [Option 2](project4option2.md) - A ticket purchase web *service* with a service-oriented backend architecture.

Option 1 is worth 100% credit. Students implementing Option 1 are *not* able to earn extra credit.

Option 2 is worth a total of 110% credit. Students who earn full credit on all criteria for option 2 will earn 110 of 100 points.

Choose which option you prefer *before* you begin. They are very different so you will not be able to switch between options without starting over from the beginning.

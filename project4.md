Project 4 - Ticket Purchase Application
=======================================

You have two options for Project 4. 

### [Option 1](project4option1.md) - A two-tier ticket purchase web *site* with a SQL backend.

### [Option 2](project4option2.md) - A ticket purchase web *service* with a service-oriented backend architecture.

Option 1 is worth 100% credit. Students implementing Option 1 are *not* able to earn extra credit.

Option 2 is worth a total of 110% credit. Students who earn full credit on all criteria for option 2 will earn 110 of 100 points.

Choose which option you prefer *before* you begin. They are very different so you will not be able to switch between options without starting over from the beginning.

Option 2 is worth more points because it is more difficult. We will not cover all of the concepts required to implement the project, so you will be expected to do some independent learning to complete this project. That's why it is worth 110%! 

It is perfectly acceptable to complete Option 1, and you are only encouraged to complete Option 2 if you feel strongly that you will be able to spend the time and effort required to learn independently.
